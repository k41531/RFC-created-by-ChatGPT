Title: The Galactic Interplanetary Internet Protocol
Authors: John Doe, Jane Doe

Abstract:

This document defines the Galactic Interplanetary Internet Protocol (GIIP), which is a
protocol for exchanging information between spaceships and planets in the galaxy. GIIP
provides a hierarchical addressing system that allows each spaceship and planet to be
uniquely identified, and specifies the rules for data transmission between them.

1. Introduction

The Galactic Interplanetary Internet Protocol (GIIP) is a protocol for exchanging
information between spaceships and planets in the galaxy. GIIP uses a hierarchical
addressing system that allows each spaceship and planet to be uniquely identified
by its own IP address. This address consists of three parts: the planet or spaceship
name, the local network name, and the host name.

2. Data Transmission

Data transmission in GIIP is based on the principle of "distance-dependent speed".
This means that the speed of data transmission varies depending on the physical
distance between the sender and the receiver. For example, data transmission between
planets occurs at the speed of light, while data transmission between spaceships
occurs at the speed of ultra-light.

3. Error Correction

In order to prevent errors in data transmission, GIIP uses a cyclic redundancy
check (CRC) algorithm to detect and correct errors in the data. This algorithm
calculates a checksum for each block of data and compares it with the original
checksum to detect and correct any errors.

4. Communication Failure

In the case of communication failure, GIIP provides a mechanism for retrying the
data transmission. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgement from the
receiver within a certain time period, it will retransmit the data up to a
predefined number of times. If the data cannot be successfully transmitted,
GIIP will generate an error message and terminate the communication.

5. Conclusion

The Galactic Interplanetary Internet Protocol (GIIP) is a protocol for exchanging
information between spaceships and planets in the galaxy. GIIP provides a hierarchical
addressing system that allows each spaceship and planet to be uniquely identified,
and specifies the rules for data transmission between them.
